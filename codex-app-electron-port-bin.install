==> codex-app-electron-port-bin installed.

This is an unofficial Electron-port repackaging from the macOS DMG.
Upstream layout or internals may change and require PKGBUILD updates.

Required after install:
  1. Install native rebuild prerequisites (if not already installed)
       sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel python nodejs pnpm sudo

  2. Install Codex CLI (optional, but recommended for app integration)
       pnpm setup
       pnpm add -g @openai/codex

  3. Rebuild native modules for your installed Electron version
       codex-app-electron-port-bin-rebuild-native

     Note: the helper may prompt for your sudo password to update files in /opt.
     Note: if pnpm blocks build scripts, run `pnpm approve-builds` and retry.

  4. Launch the app
       codex-app-electron-port-bin

If Electron is updated later, rerun:
  codex-app-electron-port-bin-rebuild-native
